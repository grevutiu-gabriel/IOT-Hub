# IOT-Hub
A device agnostic IOT device controller with mobile web app.

This project was designed for my final year project at University. It is capable of controlling some devices and its device support can be easily extended by adding a new 'driver' file for the said device.

Driver files are located in /ControllerBackend/private/application/libraries/drivers. Driver files are referenced in the database.
